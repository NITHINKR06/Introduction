        "Hello everyone, I'm Nithin, and I’m thrilled to be here today. I graduated in Computer Science Engineering with a specialization in Cyber Security from NMAMIT, where I gained a solid foundation in both the theoretical and practical sides of cybersecurity. <br><br>

I’m an ENFP, also known as a "Campaigner." This means I’m naturally enthusiastic, creative, and open-minded, which makes me a strong team player and someone who enjoys connecting with others. I’m always excited to explore new ideas and tackle challenges, and I believe my curiosity and positive energy help me bring fresh perspectives to my work. <br><br>

My technical skills include programming languages like C, C++, and Python, along with front-end and back-end development using the MERN stack. I’m comfortable working across different operating systems, including Windows and Linux, which helps me adapt easily to various environments. <br><br>

I’ve had the chance to intern in web development and penetration testing, which taught me how to create secure applications and identify potential security issues. I also spent two years as a web penetration tester at Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services, where I was responsible for finding and fixing vulnerabilities in web applications. My time as a web developer at Microsoft gave me valuable insights into the software development lifecycle and best practices for building user-friendly, secure applications. <br><br>

With my ENFP traits, I bring an energetic and collaborative approach to my work, always aiming to inspire others and learn continuously. I’m passionate about cybersecurity, and I stay updated on the latest trends and technologies to keep improving my skills. <br><br>

I'm excited about the opportunity to contribute my experience, creativity, and enthusiasm to a new team. Thank you for your time!"
